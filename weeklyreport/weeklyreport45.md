### Team Meeting 

Several members of the team do not know each other. So we decided to all introduce ourselves one by one. To get to know each other better.

*All Team*

### Brainstorming about the different roles : 

For the whole team, except for Remy, this was our initial project involving the assignment of roles to each team member. 

We decided to carefully examine the role of each team member, aiming to improve efficiency and organization in the following stages of our project.

*All Team*

### Advancement of our Functional

Initiating the project, our team collaborated on functional formatting and brainstormed initial ideas. Thibaud then led the process of selecting and organizing the functional aspects.  <br>

*Thibaud Marlier*<br>

The program manager in charge of the functional, has given the QA some tasks to do to help the progress with the functional.

Template creation

### DOSbox 

We started to download DOSbox and understood how it worked. In addition, we tried to understand how to make an assembly language program work with DOSbox. We also attempted to link NASM with DOSbox to start coding and understanding assembly.

*Rémy Charles and Junior Sofware Engineer* 

The junior software engineers managed to understand DOSbox and link it up with NASM. They are now able to launch the program and begin to understand the assembly. 

*Habi Cailleau and Raphël Proudh*on 

### Advancement of our Readme 

Started writing the README to give the Stakeholder a better understanding of our project.

### Brainstorming ideas for our Pac Man version  

#### New features :

First of all, we thought together about our Pac Man environment. 
In other words, a new map with new colors, a new universe, a new Pac Man... <br>

We've also been thinking about improving the game in terms of choice. With a new menu, allowing us to change the color of our character. For those who don't know the game, here's a detail of the regels. And a category option to decrease or increase the sound.
