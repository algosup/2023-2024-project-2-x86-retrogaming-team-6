### Team Meeting 

Several members of the team do not know each other. So we decided to all introduce ourselves one by one. To get to know each other better.

*All team member*

### Brainstorming about the differents roles : 

For the whole team except Remy it was our first project with roles assigned to everyone. 

We therefore decided to try to understand in more detail the role of each member of the team. To be more efficient and more organized in the rest of our project.

### Advancement of our Functional

Work on functional formatting and first ideas about the project. Our team brainstormed ideas and then Thibaud took charge of selecting and organizing the functional.  <br>

### DOSbox 

We've started to download DOSbox and understand how it works. In addition, we'll try to understand how to make an assembly language program work with DOSbox. We're also trying to link NASM with DOSbox to start coding and understanding assembly. 

*Rémy Charles and Junior Sofware Engineer* 

The junior software engineers managed to understand DOSbox and link it up with NASM. They are now able to launch the program and begin to understand the assembly. 

*Habi cailleau and Raphël Proudh*on 

### Advancement of our Readme 

Start writing the README to give the Stakholder a better understanding of our project.

### Brainstorming ideas for our Pac Man version  

#### New features :

First of all, we thought together about our Pac Man environment. 
In other words, a new map with new colors, a new universe, a new Pac Man... <br>

We've also been thinking about improving the game in terms of choice. With a new menu, allowing us to change the color of our character. For those who don't know the game, here's a detail of the regels. And a category option to decrease or increase the sound.
