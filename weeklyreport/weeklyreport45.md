### Team Meeting 

Several members of the team do not know each other. So we decided to all introduce ourselves one by one. To get to know each other better.

### Brainstorming about the differents roles : 

For the whole team except Remy it was our first project with roles assigned to everyone. 

We therefore decided to try to understand in more detail the role of each member of the team. To be more efficient and more organized in the rest of our project.

### Advancement of our Functional

Work on functional formatting and first ideas about the project. Our team brainstormed ideas and then Thibaud took charge of selecting and organizing the functional.  <br>
