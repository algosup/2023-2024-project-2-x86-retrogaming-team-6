### Technical Specification 

The technical is finished being written. And ready for delivery. And it's been checked and corrected.

### Learning Assembly and Code 

This week we managed to keep our pac man on the move. He can now move in all directions (up, down, left, right). 

The junior software engineers are working on opening and closing the mouth as the pac man moves forward.
