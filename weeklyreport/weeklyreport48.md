### <br> Technical Specification 

The technical is finished being written. And ready for delivery. And it's been checked and corrected. The technical was handed down on Tuesday November 27. 

*Rémy Charles, Thibaud Marlier & Manech Lenguens*

### Learning Assembly and Code 

* This week we managed to keep our pac man on the move. He can now move in all directions (up, down, left, right). 

  To do this, junior software engineers had to understand how to use the position of pixels in relation to our 320 by 200 screen. And then be able to link it to the player's keystrokes to make it move wherever he wants. 

* The junior software engineers are working on opening and closing the mouth as the pac man  moves when he eat some point. 

  To do this, we need to create 3 different sprites. 1 sprite with its mouth closed, another with its mouth half open, and the last with its mouth completely open.

*Junior Software Engineer & Rémy Charles* 

### QA Test Plan

Our QA is still writing and finalizing its test plan. Which must be ready for our prototype test. 

*Manech Laguens* 

### Management and Document 

Here's an update on our game development organization. 

We had to code a menu to select between playing the game or the settings. Unfortunately, we're a little behind schedule. 

To solve this problem, we'll leave the menu aside for the moment. Then we'll finish a playable, bug-free version of our game before adding extras like the menu or the score. 

The devellopers and other team members will concentrate on the pac man's collisions with the walls. But we're also working on the problem of the pac man's size, which is too small compared to the size of the labyrinth's corridors.  

*Raphaël Descamps* 

### Next week's schedule 

Here are the tasks we'd like to accomplish over the next week. 

* First to finish: the problem of Pac Man colliding with our Maze's blackberries. 

* Now that we've managed to display the ghosts, we need to solve the collision problem with them too, and start encoding the different powers they possess. 

* Secondly, the finalization of our QA Test Plan.
