### <br> Technical Specification 

The Technical Specification has been completely written. We fully corrected and checked, we then handed it down on the 12/27/23.

### Learning Assembly and Code 

* During this week, we succeeded to make ou Pac-Man changing direction, he can now go in every direction, which are up, down, left and right. 

  To do so, junior software engineers had to understand how to use the position of pixels in relation to our 320 by 200 screen. And then be able to link it to the player's command to make it move wherever he wants. 

* The junior software engineers worked on opening and closing Pac-Mans mouth whenever he eats a point. 

  To do this, we had to create 3 different sprites. A first sprite with its mouth closed, a second one with its mouth half open, and the third with its mouth completely open.

### QA Test Plan

Our QA is still writing and finalizing its test plan. Which must be ready for our prototype test. 

*Manech Laguens* 

### Management and Document 

Here's an update on our game development organization. 

We had to code a menu to select between playing the game or the settings. Unfortunately, we're a little behind schedule. 

To solve this problem, we'll leave the menu aside for the moment. We prefer to show a playable, bug-free version of our game before adding extras like the menu or the score. 

The developers and other team members will focus on the Pac-Man's collisions with the walls. We're also working on an issue concerning Pac-Mans size, which is too small compared to the labyrinth's corridors.  

To conclude, we updated various documents such as the Gantts diagram and the project charter.

### Next week's schedule 

Here are the tasks we would like to realize during the upcoming week.

* First to finish: the problem of Pac Man colliding with our Maze's walls. 

* Now that we've managed to display the ghosts, we need to solve the collision problem with them too, and start encoding the different powers they possess. 

* Finally, the finalization of our QAs Test Plan.
