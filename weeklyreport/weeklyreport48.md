### Technical Specification 

The technical is finished being written. And ready for delivery. And it's been checked and corrected.

### Learning Assembly and Code 

This week we managed to keep our pac man on the move. He can now move in all directions (up, down, left, right). 

The junior software engineers are working on opening and closing the mouth as the pac man moves forward.

### QA Test Plan

Our QA is still writing and finalizing its test plan. Which must be ready for our prototype test.

### Management and Document 

Here's an update on our game development organization. 

We had to code a menu to select between playing the game or the settings. Unfortunately, we're a little behind schedule. 

To solve this problem, we'll leave the menu aside for the moment. Then we'll finish a playable, bug-free version of our game before adding extras like the menu or the score. 

The devellopers and other team members will concentrate on the pac man's collisions with the walls. But we're also working on the problem of the pac man's size, which is too small compared to the size of the labyrinth's corridors.
