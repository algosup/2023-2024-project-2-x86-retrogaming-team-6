### <br> Oral exam 

For this last week of the project. We have finished our slide show which will be presented on Friday 12/22/2023. 

In addition, each team member is learning their lines and practicing on their own. We've also booked a practice hour in the amphitheatre to get ready for the Friday show. 

### Learning Assembly and Code 

The developers are in the process of finalizing the last changes that can still be made before our presentation. 

We have completed the collisions for the characters in our game. But there are still some bugs when moving to certain tunnels. 

Our developers have managed to make the ghosts move. Unfortunately, only one moves at a time, so they're trying to solve this problem. 

We've abandoned the score idea for lack of time. 

### QA Test 

Our QA is still testing the game as soon as a new feature becomes available. And reports on any problems he finds during testing.
