### <br> Learning Assembly and Code 

We realized that our sprite maze was actually a bad idea. 

Because to determine the game's borders and ensure that our pac man doesn't cross the walls, with a sprite maze it's going to be too complicated to determine. 

This means we'd have to code pixel by pixel to determine which pixels are crossed and which are not. 

So we decided to code our maze in ascii code. All we have to do is determine which color not to cross. 

It'll be much simpler and much faster. Instead of defining each pixel of the maze sprite.

### QA Test Plan

Our QA is just finishing writing his test plan. 

He is currently adding a table of content to his test plan. 

Once his test plan is finished, corrected and checked, he'll turn his attention to testing our prototype, which is due to be finished by the end of this week.
