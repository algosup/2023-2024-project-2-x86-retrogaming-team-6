### <br> Learning Assembly and Code 

We realized that our sprite maze was actually a bad idea. 

Because to determine the game's borders and ensure that our pac man doesn't cross the walls, with a sprite maze it's going to be too complicated to determine. 

This means we'd have to code pixel by pixel to determine which pixels are crossed and which are not. 

So we decided to code our maze in ascii code. All we have to do is determine which color not to cross. 

It'll be much simpler and much faster. Instead of defining each pixel of the maze sprite.

### QA Test Plan

Our QA is just finishing writing his test plan. 

He is currently adding a table of content to his test plan. 

Once his test plan is finished, corrected and checked, he'll turn his attention to testing our prototype, which is due to be finished by the end of this week.

### Management

To solve our delay problem and ensure delivery of our game on the right date. 

This week, the Program Manager and Le techlead will be working in cohesion with our Junior Software Engineer to move forward as quickly and efficiently as possible on our game. 

In the meantime, the QA will continue drafting its test plan, as described above. 

The project manager will then write all the documents he's supposed to hand in, and once finished, he'll also help the software engineers with the development of our game.

### Next week's schedule 

Here are the tasks we would like to realize during the upcoming week.

* We really need to make progress on the project and the game's develoments, such as colisions. 

* We'd better get started on the slideshow and the lyrics for each team member.
