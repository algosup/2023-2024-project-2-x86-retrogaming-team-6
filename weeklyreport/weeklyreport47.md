### Technical Specification progress 

The technical is well advanced, so we're waiting for the developers to be much more advanced on their code for the game. Despite this, all ideas are written, selected and sorted. 

*Rémy Charles & Thibaud Marlier 

### Management and Document 

A "Mangement" document, listing all documents related to team management, has been written and published on our Github, making it easier for StakHodlder to follow our progress on this project. 

In addition, a document called "Difficulties Documents Managements" has been written and will be kept throughout the project to record the difficulties and solutions we faced during the project. This document is available as a clickable link in the "Management" document.
