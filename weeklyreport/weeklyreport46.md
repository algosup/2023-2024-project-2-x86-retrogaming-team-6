### Advencement of our functional 

The functional is finished being written. Then it was uploaded to our github.

### Advencement of our Technical 

The technical work is progressing, to be finished on schedule and to allow the developer to start developing our version of pac man. 

*Rémy Charles*

### Assembly knowledge

the engineering softwares are well advanced in their reading of the assembly book. What's more, they're working on their own to understand it better and better. They're practicing on exercises given by the speakers. And they're starting to try their hand at coding our game.

What's more, the rest of the team is working on learning assembly so that they can help the software engineers when needed.

*All Team* 

### Project management 

For the organization and distribution of tasks within the team. The project manager has set up an online timetable where each team member can see what they've done and how much time they have to organize their tasks. This allows us to be much more organized and save time in our work.

The weekly report is also being written. As well as updating our Gantt to keep track of our team's work.

### Development of our game 

Now that our junior Softwar engineers have some knowledge of assembly. So they started by choosing a card for our game and began coding it to get a feel for it.

### Advencement about the Test Plan

Our QA is looking for information to start writing his Test Plan. 

*Manech Laguens* 

### Advencement of our Technical 

At the end of the week, the techlead and program manager decided to work together on editing the technical section, to be more efficient. 

*Rémy Charles & Thibaud Marlier* 

### Our ideas 

After brainstorming all the ideas in terms of map design, powers to be added and customizations. Our Program Manager decided to create a form and send it out to all the school's students. We then asked the other students to give their opinion on our ideas. Then, if they wished, they could give us advice or ideas on certain designs to improve the ideas we wanted to implement in our game. 

*Thibaud Marlier & All Team* 

### Next week's schedule 

* The junior software engineers must continue to work on their assembly skills, like all the other team members. But they need to make progress on the game's code. More specifically, they need to finish coding our map and start creating the monsters if the map is finished coding.

* The program manager and tech lead will continue to write the functional in order to deliver it on time, on 11/27/2023. And to enable the junior software engineer to continue developing the game.

* The QA will have to check the documents supplied to him, such as our weekly report and the technical.

* The project manager will continue to distribute tasks to each team member, and will then continue to draft the weekly report and its diagrams and documents to keep the team's various information up to date.
