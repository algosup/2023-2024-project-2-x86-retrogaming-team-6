### <br> Oral Exam  

We started writing our plan for our oral exam. 

In addition, we also started writing the oral notes for each team member.

Furthermore, we found a nice template for our slideshow so we were able to start the slideshow.

### Learning Assembly and Code 

Over the weekend, our junior software engineers began developing the character colisions. 

This means that when our pac man wants to turn but there's a wall, he won't be able to. 

They are also working on the development of the ghosts and their movements, since our ghosts have to move on their own.

### Next week's schedule 

Here are the tasks we would like to realize during the upcoming week.

* We need to finish the collisions and the ghost movements. 

* We should make a bar with the score if we have time. 

* We must finish the writing and the slideshow for the oral exam, the earlier we're done, the more we will have time to practice for the big day.
