### <br> Examen oral 

We've started writing our plan for our oral exam. 

In addition, we've also started writing the lyrics for each team member. 

But we also started to find the template for our slideshow and to start the first pages of our slideshow.

### Learning Assembly and Code 

Over the weekend, our junior software engineers began developing the character colisions. 

This means that when our pac man wants to turn but there's a wall, he won't be able to. 

They are also about the development of ghosts and their movements. Because our ghosts have to move on their own, and some have powers such as following the pac man.

### Next week's schedule 

Here are the tasks we would like to realize during the upcoming week.

* We need to finish the collisions and the ghost movements. 

* We should make a bar with the score if we have time. 

* Finish writing our oral exam and then finish the slideshow of this oral exam to have time to practice before the big day.
