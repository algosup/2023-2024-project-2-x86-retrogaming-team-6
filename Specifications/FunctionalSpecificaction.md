### 1 - Introduction 
#### 1.1 Pac-Man®
The Pac-Man video game was released on October 25, 1980, in the USA. It is a maze action game developed by Namco, originally for arcades. The player controls Pac-Man, who is chased by four different ghosts in a maze. The player's goal is to eat every dot in the maze to complete the level and move on to the next one.

But there's a twist: large flashing dots, named "Power Pellets", turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable to the player's attacks and giving bonus points.

#### 1.2 Assembly language
Assembly is a low-level programming language, created in 1947, closely related to the architecture of a CPU. Each assembly language instruction corresponds to a specific operation that the CPU can perform, such as arithmetic calculations, data movement, and control flow. Assembly is used to write programs that interact directly with a computer's hardware and control its operations. Assembly is specific to a particular CPU architecture, and code written for one type of CPU may not be compatible with another. 

#### 1.3 
We have a deep appreciation for the history of video games and we are  particularly fascinated by the arcade era. We discovered Pac-Man in our childhood and became captivated by its simplicity and challenging gameplay. We are computer science students who are intrigued by the technical aspects of classic arcade games.
We want to recreate the game in a challenging way, with Assembly. 
We want to push ourselves and make the version of Pac-Man® we always dreamed of.
We want to give our best while keeping the original and timeless format of Pac-Man®
