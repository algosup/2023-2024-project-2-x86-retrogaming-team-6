# Pac-Man Recreation for DOSBox - Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the technical framework for the Pac-Man game recreation on DOSBox using 1980s assembly language. It defines the specifications, system architecture, module breakdown, and development requirements.

### 1.2 Scope
Development of a Pac-Man game clone to run in a DOSBox environment, constructed with assembly language in the style of 1980s programming.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Game Design
- **Objective**: Replicate the original Pac-Man gameplay experience.
- **Graphics**: Emulate original Pac-Man graphics within DOSBox limitations.
- **Sound**: Implement a PC speaker-based sound system.

### 2.2 User Interface
- **Input**: Keyboard navigation for character movement.
- **Output**: Visual display via DOSBox and audio through PC speaker emulation.

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements
- DOS-compatible system with 8086/8088 processor.
- At least 512KB of RAM.
- CGA/EGA/VGA compatible graphics.
- PC speaker for audio output.

### 3.2 Software Requirements

- **MS-DOS 5.0 or higher**: The underlying operating system for which the game is being developed.
- **DOSBox 0.74 or newer**: An emulator that recreates a DOS environment with an x86 architecture, including:
    - **CPU Emulation**: Simulates Intel 8086/286/386 CPUs.
    - **Graphics Emulation**: Supports CGA, EGA, VGA, and VESA standards.
    - **Sound Emulation**: Reproduces sound cards like the AdLib and Sound Blaster.
    - **Input Emulation**: Captures keyboard and mouse input for use within DOSBox.
    - **Memory Management**: Emulates conventional, expanded (EMS), and extended (XMS) memory.
    - **Peripheral Support**: Emulates joysticks, serial ports, and modems.
    - **Networking**: Simulates IPX networking for multiplayer sessions.
    - **Extensibility**: Allows for custom configurations and plugins.

#### Additional Tools Required for Development

- **Assembler (MASM or TASM)**: Converts assembly language source code into executable machine code.
- **Text Editor**: Software like Vim, Emacs, or VSCode for writing and editing source code.
- **Debugger**: Turbo Debugger or DOSBox Debugger for code inspection and troubleshooting.
- **Version Control**: Software like Git, with usage managed through the host operating system or a DOS-compatible client.
- **DOSBox Frontends**: Optional GUIs like D-Fend Reloaded to simplify DOSBox configuration and management.
- **Image Editing Tools**: Applications capable of creating and editing sprite graphics in formats suitable for DOS games (e.g., BMP, PCX, TGA).
- **Documentation Tools**: Markdown editors or LaTeX for maintaining project documentation.

**Note**: While DOSBox provides a comprehensive suite of emulation capabilities for developing DOS-based software, it is an emulation environment. Discrepancies can exist between its behavior and that of genuine DOS hardware, which developers should consider when testing and optimizing their code.

Developers should ensure their environment is correctly set up to interface with DOSBox, including correct path configurations for assemblers and toolchains, as well as adequate testing routines to verify that their code operates as expected both within the emulator and, if possible, on actual DOS hardware.

### 3.3 Development Environment
- **Assembler**: MASM or similar 1980s assembler.
- **Text Editor**: Any basic text editor for ASCII text.
- **Version Control**: Git or equivalent for DOS.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Module Decomposition
- **Game Logic Module**: Manages state and rules.
- **Graphics Module**: Handles rendering.
- **Input Module**: Processes keyboard input.
- **Sound Module**: Manages audio production.
- **Memory Management Module**: Optimizes resource utilization.

### 4.2 Data Flow
`Include a data flow diagram here.`

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Gameplay Mechanics
- **Maze Logic**: True to original gameplay.
- **Ghost AI**: Emulates original ghost behaviors.
- **Scoring**: Points for various in-game actions.
- **Level Progression**: Handles game difficulty scaling.

### 5.2 Controls
`Document the control scheme.`

### 5.3 Performance
- **Frame Rate**: Consistent with the original game.
- **Responsiveness**: Minimal input delay.

## 6. Non-functional Requirements

### 6.1 Usability
Easy to understand and play, minimal learning curve.

### 6.2 Reliability
Stable under erroneous input and system failures.

### 6.3 Portability
Structured for easy adaptation to other DOS systems.

## 7. Development Timeline

Use a Gantt chart to outline phases and milestones.

## 8. Testing

### 8.1 Unit Testing
Ensure individual module functionality.

### 8.2 Integration Testing
Verify modules in combination.

### 8.3 System Testing
Complete game playthrough validation.
