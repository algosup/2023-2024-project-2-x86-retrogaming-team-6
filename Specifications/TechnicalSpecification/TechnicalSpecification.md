## 5. Data Management
### 5.1 Data Storage
Efficient data management is critical for the performance and stability of the Pac-Man® project. The team will implement data storage strategies optimized for Assembly language on x86 architecture, focusing on compactness and speed.

#### Game Data Storage:
- **Maze Data:**
  - **Structure:** Store maze layout in a compact binary format, using a two-dimensional array. Each cell represents a section of the maze, encoded for walls, paths, and item locations.
  
  - **Example:** `maze_data DB 0x0F, 0x1B, 0x0F ... ; maze represented in hex`
  
  - **Access:** Implement efficient routines for reading and writing to this array, ensuring quick updates during gameplay.

- **Game State:**
  - **Representation:** Utilize a set of registers or a contiguous block of memory to store the current game state, including player scores, lives, and level.

  - **Example:** `game_state DB 3 ; 3 lives, score DW 0 ; initial score 0`
  
  - **Update Mechanism:** Develop routines to update this state after key game events like scoring or losing a life.

#### High Score Management:
- **Storage Mechanism:** Use a structured format for high scores, with a fixed-size record for each entry (e.g., player initials and score).

  - **Implementation:** `high_scores DB 'AAA', 5000, 'BBB', 4500 ... ; high scores table`
  
  - **Retrieval and Update:** Implement procedures for sorting and updating this table whenever a new high score is achieved.

#### Character Data:
- **Pac-Man® and Ghosts:**
  - **Data Structure:** Store each character’s position, direction, and state. Optimize the representation to occupy minimal memory space.
  
  - **Example:** `pacman DB x_position, y_position, direction, state`
  
  - **Movement and Update:** Efficiently update these data points in response to game events or player inputs.

#### Power-Up and Bonus Items:
- **Item Tracking:** Keep track of power-ups and bonus items with flags or counters, indicating their states and locations.

The data management approach is tailored for Assembly language programming, ensuring that data structures are lean and access routines are efficient. This strategy will support the game's need for fast and frequent data access, a critical aspect of real-time gameplay on the x86 platform.

### 5.2 Memory Optimization
Optimizing memory usage is a critical aspect of the Pac-Man® project, particularly given the constraints of Assembly language and x86 architecture. The development team will employ strategies to ensure that the game uses memory resources efficiently, reducing the risk of overruns and enhancing performance.

#### Optimization Strategies:
- **Memory Allocation:** Careful allocation of memory resources, avoiding unnecessary memory consumption. For instance, using registers for frequently accessed data and reserving memory blocks only as needed.

  - **Example:** `MOV AX, gameState ; storing game state in a register for quick access`
  
- **Data Structure Efficiency:** Using data structures that minimize memory overhead. Optimize the size of variables and arrays to match the exact requirements of the game data.
  
  - **Example:** `DB 0x00 ; using a byte for simple flags instead of larger data types`
  
- **Memory Reuse and Recycling:** Where possible, reuse memory blocks for different purposes throughout the game lifecycle, rather than allocating new memory each time.
  
  - **Implementation:** Implement routines to clear and repurpose memory blocks once they are no longer needed.

#### Memory Management Techniques:
- **Buffer Management:** Efficient management of buffers, especially for rendering and input handling, to ensure they do not consume more memory than necessary.
  
- **Heap vs Stack Usage:** Strategic use of the stack for temporary data and the heap for more permanent data, balancing between quick access and dynamic memory needs.
  
- **Garbage Collection:** Implementing manual garbage collection routines to free up memory space that is no longer in use, particularly in longer gameplay sessions.

#### Monitoring and Profiling:
- **Memory Profiling:** Regularly profiling the game to monitor memory usage patterns and identify areas where optimizations can be made.
  
- **Debugging Tools:** Utilizing debugging tools that provide insights into memory allocation, usage, and potential leaks.

#### Handling Memory Constraints:
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Establishing fallback mechanisms in case of memory allocation failures, such as simplifying game elements or reducing the complexity of certain operations.
  
- **Optimization Loops:** Continuously refining memory usage through iterative development cycles, constantly seeking improvements and optimizations.

Through these memory optimization strategies, the team will ensure that the Pac-Man® project runs efficiently on the targeted hardware, maintaining a balance between performance, complexity, and the immersive experience of the game.
