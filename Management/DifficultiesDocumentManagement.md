### <br> Communication issues 

Right from the start of the project, we were all kind of strangers to each other. We hadn't really spoken to each other during the last project. 

That's why right from the start of the project, we had some problems with communication and each other's vision of the game. 

So we decided, at the very beginning of the project in the first week, to put in place a system of communication. Meetins, where everyone was asked to give their opinion on subjects of importance to the further development of the game. 

### NASM and DOSBox issues

Our problem with DOSBox was that we didn't understand how it worked with NASM. And especially how to run our code on DOSBox. 

So we did some research on NASM and discovered that there were several assemblers like NASM. We found some older, non-updated assemblers like TASM and MASM. 

So we did some research and in our computer science classes we learned to use NASM. What's more, NASM is the most recent assembler still in use today. 

### Game design problems 

We also had a few problems when we wanted to start designing our map, and the Pac Man characters.

First, we started using aseprite software. Which is a program that lets you draw with any number of pixels. After a few hours of drawing, we realized that we couldn't save because we had to buy the paid version. 

As a result, we tried a new software, Gimp, which was a little more complicated but free. Unfortunately, the output of our "drawing" should be in bmp. But when we wanted to export our drawing in bmp, it didn't work. 

To overcome all these problems, we decided to buy the paid version of asperite. It's much more practical than Gimp and allows us to export our design as a bmp file. 

### Delayed game code 

Week three has just begun, we're due to hand in our prototype on December 11th and our developers are struggling to get started on the game code. 

D n addition, to finish our technical specification, our developers need to make progress on the game code. Moreover, the technical specification is due on December 27, so we're a little behind schedule. 

We've decided to get a head start on each of our respective tasks to get a little more involved in the assembly to help our developers start creating our version of Pac Man. 

### Maze issues 

At the start of our game's development, we began coding our maze in sprite. 

But unfortunately we had to change the code of our maze. We decided to code it in ASCII, as this will enable us to better manage character collisions on the maze walls in the future. 

### Coding game issue 

During the 6-week project, the whole team worked to make the best version of the Pac Man game. 

Unfortunately, this was due to a lack of understanding of the assembly and a lack of skills.  We didn't manage to make the Pac Man version we wanted. 

So we had to put aside some of the game's features when we wanted to add them. For example, we didn't have time to add a score bar, or to add player lives. 
Nor did we have time to add powers or behaviors to the game's ghosts. 

So we concentrated on the most important parts of the game to create a Pac Man-like game.
