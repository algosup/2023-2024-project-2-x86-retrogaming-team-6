### NASM and DOSBox issues

Our problem with DOSBox was that we didn't understand how it worked with NASM. And especially how to run our code on DOSBox. 

So we did some research on NASM and discovered that there were several assemblers like NASM. We found some older, non-updated assemblers like TASM and MASM. 

So we did some research and in our computer science classes we learned to use NASM. What's more, NASM is the most recent assembler still in use today. 

### Game design problems 

We also had a few problems when we wanted to start designing our map, and the Pac Man characters.

First, we started using aseprite software. Which is a program that lets you draw with any number of pixels. After a few hours of drawing, we realized that we couldn't save because we had to buy the paid version. 

As a result, we tried a new software, Gimp, which was a little more complicated but free. Unfortunately, the output of our "drawing" should be in bmp. But when we wanted to export our drawing in bmp, it didn't work. 

To overcome all these problems, we decided to buy the paid version of asperite. It's much more practical than Gimp and allows us to export our design as a bmp file.
